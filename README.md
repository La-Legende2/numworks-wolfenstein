# NumWolfenstein

A simple Wolfenstein 3D clone for the NumWorks calculator.

## Running on your calculator

Make sure you have NodeJS installed first

1. Connect your calculator
2. As for most Zig projects, you only need to execute
```sh
zig build run -Drelease-fast
```
(`-Drelease-fast` is recommended even in debug for the app to run at reasonable speed)
